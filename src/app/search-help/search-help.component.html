    <h1>Tips to Improve Your Search Results</h1>
    <h2>General:</h2>
    <p>
        If you are looking for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information across multiple projects: use global search.</li>
        <li>Project specific information: use project landing page search.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        (Note: this will remove the extra returns on a query)
    </p>
    <h2>Tools to Refine Your Search:</h2>
    <h3>Tabs</h3>
    <p>
        On the top of the global search are several tabs: Projects, Documents and Valued Components. Using these tabs can help refine your search.
    </p>
    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <p>
        When searching for something specific, try using quotes. When search parameters are in quotes the search engine will search for the whole phrase rather than the individual words.
        For instance, if you search Section 11 Order, the engine will return content that contains those three words in any order – i.e. returning all results that include the word order, section, and anything with an 11.
        However, if you search “Section 11 Order”, it will search for that phrase exactly as you typed it. (Note: when using quotes upper- and lower-case letters count.)
        Using quotes can help locate specific information that may be buried under other content.
        To refine a search further try using a string of parameters within quotes. For example, if you search “Section 11 Order” “2013” it will return only Section 11 Orders with a date of 2013.
    </p>
    <h3>Hyphens</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes words are ambiguous or found in multiple situations, which makes searching for specific items which use these words difficult.
        For example, the word Application has many meanings and is found in various types of documents.
        But you may want to find all the documents that include the word Application except any “Application Information Requirements” documents.
        The hyphen tells the search to remove any results that include the words which follow it. It is like an “ignore/except” button.
        <bR><br>Using the hyphen, this is how you would search for all Applications except Application Information Requirement Documents:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application –Information Requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This tells the search engine to search for the word Application but to remove any results that have the word “Information Requirements”.
        This tool can be wildly helpful when searching for information about one topic while removing all the known, unwanted results.
        <br><br>This is how you would write a search to find Applications, -not including information requirements “in 2013”
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application -Information Requirements “2013”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
